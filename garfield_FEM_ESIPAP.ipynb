on the exercises\n","Starting from the above, one can write a loop to perform avalanches over various configurations (gas mixtures, LEM radii, and field configurations).

For example:\n","\n","```\n","# Loop over LEM radii\n","LEM_radii = [0.01, 0.015, 0.02]\n","for rlem in LEM_radii:\n","\n","  # Loop over LEM voltages.\n","  LEM_deltaV = np.arange(1500,1800,50)\n","  for deltaV in LEM_deltaV:\n","    \n","    # Perform N avalanches.\n","    N = 100\n","    for i in N:\n","      \n","      # Perform the avalanche and extract/record the number of electrons.\n","      ...\n","\n","    # Record the mean avalanche gain and error on the mean.\n","```\n","\n","Note that for calculations of LEM transparency (the probability that an electron approaching the LEM from above will pass through a LEM hole and is collected on the other side), it will be easier to use the `DriftElectron` method of the `AvalancheMicroscopic` class, rather than `AvalancheElectron`, as a full avalanche computation is not necessary in this case.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1qG914_VJr2P"},"source":["### Initial setup\n","Here we will set relevant LEM parameters in
